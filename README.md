This project demonstrates a full end-to-end CI/CD workflow on AWS.

The goal is to simulate a real-world production-like deployment process:

Infrastructure provisioning → Container build → Deployment → Logging → Cloud storage.

🏗 Architecture Overview

Terraform provisions an EC2 instance.

A Docker image is built for a Python application.

The CI/CD pipeline deploys the container to EC2.

The application runs inside Docker.

Application logs are uploaded to S3 for persistence.

🛠 Tech Stack

AWS (EC2, S3, IAM)

Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

Docker

Python

CI/CD (Jenkins / GitHub Actions / etc.)


⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ Provision Infrastructure

Terraform creates:

EC2 instance

Security Group

IAM Role (if configured)

S3 bucket (for logs)

Run:

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
2️⃣ Build Docker Image
docker build -t python-app .
3️⃣ Run Container Locally (Optional)
docker run -p 5000:5000 python-app
4️⃣ CI/CD Flow

The pipeline performs:

Checkout code

Terraform apply (or validate)

Docker build

Push (optional, if using ECR)

SSH into EC2

Deploy container

Upload logs to S3

📦 Logging to S3

The application generates a log file.
A script (or pipeline step) uploads it to S3:

aws s3 cp app.log s3://your-bucket-name/

This simulates production-style centralized log storage.

🎯 Learning Goals

This project focuses on:

Understanding Infrastructure as Code

Automating deployments

Working with containers in cloud environments

Managing cloud resources securely

Designing a clean CI/CD flow

🔐 Future Improvements

Add automated tests in pipeline

Use ECR instead of local Docker build

Add monitoring (Prometheus / CloudWatch)

Use Auto Scaling Group instead of single EC2

Store Terraform state remotely (S3 + DynamoDB)

👨‍💻 Why I Built This

The purpose of this project is to deeply understand the full lifecycle of deploying an application to the cloud — not just running a server, but managing infrastructure, containers, and deployment automation as a complete system.
